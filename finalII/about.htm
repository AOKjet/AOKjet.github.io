AOK is everything and everyone. Started with four friends in middle school who wanted to be more than what is normal. The idea of being free from the shackles of judgment, the roles society puts us in, embracing abnormality and encouraging creativity.  The clothing, graphics and ideas are closely linked to personal memories, experiences and enjoyment. It's fun to feel like a kid again.  To have your mind race about what is next,  where you're going to be,  and where you'll end up.  Don't worry about the thought of failure because it is inevitable.  But through failure, We persevere, We learn, We adapt, and We improve.
